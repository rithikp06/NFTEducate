                NFTs are an up-and-coming technology that has the potential to change the world. Our goal is to promote NFTs and educate people about them. We want to break down the barriers and skepticism around NFTs to help accelerate their use. Moreover, the layman does not know much about and can be intimidated by the term NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS. These tokens can be used by all, as collectibles or as secure contracts. We at NFT Educate hope to teach you about NFTs and help you purchase and enjoy them.
